How to run the test suite:

### CardGAmeTestSuite.java runs the following test classes: 
    TestDeck.class,
    TestPlayer.class,
    TestCard.class,
    TestCardGame.class

Each test file contains unit tests for the methods of their respective source code file.
The folder 'TestPacks' contains files that are used as test packs in some of the unit tests so it is required to run the suite.

Uses Junit 4
